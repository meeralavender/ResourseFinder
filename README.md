### Hosted Project Link

### Project Description
[AmIEligible is a user-friendly platform that helps individuals discover government schemes, scholarships, jobs, and exams they are eligible for in under 60 seconds. By collecting basic details through an interactive step-by-step process, it filters and displays personalized opportunities instantly. The goal is to ensure no one misses out on important opportunities due to lack of awareness.
]

### The Problem statement
[Many people miss out on valuable opportunities like government schemes, scholarships, jobs, and competitive exams simply because information is scattered across multiple websites and is often difficult to understand. This lack of awareness especially affects students, women, and economically weaker sections, leading to underutilization of benefits that are meant to support them]

### The Solution
[The platform solves this by bringing all relevant opportunities into a single, easy-to-use website. Users enter basic details such as income, category (student, farmer, etc.), and location, and the system filters and displays only the opportunities they are eligible for. This personalized approach makes information accessible, saves time, and ensures users can easily find and apply for the benefits they deserve.]
